## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

**Grey Matter** is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the discovery of top-tier researchers from Bangladesh and provide detailed insights into academic journals worldwide. Developed using **React JS** and **Tailwind CSS**, **Express JS** & **Vite**. This website serves as an essential tool for novice researchers, academic professionals, students, and researchers seeking to connect with influential figures in their fields or explore journals by various key metrics. Whether you're looking to collaborate with leading researchers or find journals that align with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), **Grey Matter** offers a streamlined, user-friendly experience.

## <a name="inspiration">🎨 Inspiration</a>

The idea behind **Grey Matter** was inspired by the need to bridge the gap between researchers in Bangladesh and the global academic community. We saw, upon stepping into the vast world of reserch, many of us become clueless. We have no visible guidelines about the Know-How's of research, no dedicated platform to learn about jounal & conferences and of course, no resource to learn about the biggest academic brains of Bangladesh in different sectors. They remain in the shadows. We say no to these and tried to bring the brains to the limelight. We aim to close that knowledge gap and that feeling of hopelessness. when  We recognized the challenges that students, academics, and professionals face when trying to find the right collaborators or access detailed journal information. Our aim was to create a platform that not only highlights the remarkable talent within Bangladesh but also provides a powerful tool for discovering academic resources worldwide.
